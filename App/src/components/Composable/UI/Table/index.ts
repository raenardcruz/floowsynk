/**
 * Table Components - PrimeVue DataTable Wrapper
 * 
 * The Table component has been migrated to use PrimeVue DataTable as the underlying
 * implementation, replacing the custom Headers and Row components with a more powerful
 * and feature-rich data table solution.
 * 
 * Migration Status: âœ… COMPLETED
 * - Table: Migrated to PrimeVue DataTable wrapper with column configuration
 * - Headers: Legacy component maintained for backward compatibility during transition
 * - Row: Legacy component maintained for backward compatibility during transition
 * 
 * New Features:
 * - Built-in sorting, filtering, and pagination
 * - Column resizing and reordering
 * - Row selection and expansion
 * - Enhanced performance with virtual scrolling
 * - Responsive design support
 * - Full TypeScript support
 * 
 * Migration Notes:
 * - New Table component uses column configuration instead of Headers/Row pattern
 * - Legacy Headers and Row components are deprecated but maintained for compatibility
 * - See Table.example.vue for usage examples with the new API
