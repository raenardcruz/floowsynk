# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to consolidate and organize all CSS custom properties (variables) used throughout the FloowSynk application into a centralized system. Currently, CSS variables are scattered across multiple files and some are undefined, leading to inconsistencies and maintenance challenges. The goal is to create a comprehensive CSS variable system that ensures design consistency, improves maintainability, and provides a single source of truth for all design tokens.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all CSS variables to be defined in a centralized location, so that I can easily maintain and update the design system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all CSS variables SHALL be defined in the main style.css file or imported theme files
2. WHEN a CSS variable is used THEN it SHALL have a corresponding definition in the centralized system
3. WHEN updating design tokens THEN developers SHALL only need to modify values in one location
4. WHEN adding new CSS variables THEN they SHALL follow the established naming convention and organization structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want undefined CSS variables to be identified and properly defined, so that the styling system works correctly across all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning all CSS files THEN any undefined CSS variables SHALL be identified and documented
2. WHEN undefined variables are found THEN appropriate fallback values SHALL be provided or variables SHALL be properly defined
3. WHEN variables reference non-existent colors THEN they SHALL be mapped to existing color palette values or new values SHALL be added to the palette
4. WHEN fixing undefined variables THEN the visual appearance SHALL remain consistent with the current design

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CSS variables to follow a consistent naming convention and organization, so that they are easy to understand and use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing CSS variables THEN they SHALL be grouped by category (colors, spacing, typography, shadows, etc.)
2. WHEN naming CSS variables THEN they SHALL follow a hierarchical naming pattern (e.g., --color-primary, --color-primary-hover)
3. WHEN defining color variables THEN they SHALL include semantic names (primary, secondary, success, error) in addition to palette names
4. WHEN organizing variables THEN related variables SHALL be grouped together with clear comments

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want missing color palette values to be added to the system, so that all referenced colors are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing color usage THEN missing color palette values SHALL be identified (white, black, pink, glass, translucent variants)
2. WHEN adding missing colors THEN they SHALL follow the existing palette structure with numbered variants (1-10)
3. WHEN defining translucent colors THEN they SHALL use appropriate alpha values for transparency effects
4. WHEN adding glass effects THEN they SHALL use backdrop-filter compatible values

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CSS variable system to support both light and dark themes, so that the application can provide theme switching capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining semantic color variables THEN they SHALL support theme switching through CSS custom properties
2. WHEN implementing dark theme THEN all semantic variables SHALL have appropriate dark theme counterparts
3. WHEN switching themes THEN all components SHALL automatically adapt to the new color scheme
4. WHEN adding new semantic colors THEN both light and dark variants SHALL be defined

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CSS variable system to be well-documented, so that team members can easily understand and use the design tokens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing CSS variables THEN each section SHALL have clear comments explaining its purpose
2. WHEN defining color palettes THEN usage guidelines SHALL be provided in comments
3. WHEN creating semantic variables THEN their intended use cases SHALL be documented
4. WHEN updating the system THEN documentation SHALL be kept current with changes
