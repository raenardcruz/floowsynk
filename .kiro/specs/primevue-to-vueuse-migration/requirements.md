# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the FloowSynk Vue.js frontend application from PrimeVue components to custom components while integrating VueUse composables to streamline logic and improve code readability. The migration will maintain all existing functionality while improving maintainability, reducing bundle size, and leveraging modern Vue 3 composition patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace all PrimeVue components with custom components, so that we have better control over styling, behavior, and bundle size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the current codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all PrimeVue component usages across the application
2. WHEN replacing PrimeVue components THEN the system SHALL maintain identical functionality and user experience
3. WHEN implementing custom components THEN the system SHALL follow the existing component structure patterns (ComponentName.vue, ComponentName.styles.css, etc.)
4. WHEN creating custom components THEN the system SHALL ensure they are accessible and follow WCAG guidelines
5. IF a PrimeVue component has complex functionality THEN the system SHALL break it down into smaller, reusable custom components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate VueUse composables throughout the application, so that logic is more streamlined, reusable, and easier to test.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring component logic THEN the system SHALL replace custom utility functions with appropriate VueUse composables where available
2. WHEN implementing reactive state management THEN the system SHALL use VueUse composables like useStorage, useLocalStorage, useSessionStorage instead of manual implementations
3. WHEN handling DOM interactions THEN the system SHALL use VueUse composables like useElementSize, useResizeObserver, useIntersectionObserver
4. WHEN managing async operations THEN the system SHALL use VueUse composables like useAsyncState, useFetch, useTimeoutFn
5. WHEN working with browser APIs THEN the system SHALL use VueUse composables like useClipboard, useFullscreen, usePermission

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain consistent styling and theming across all custom components, so that the application has a cohesive visual design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating custom components THEN the system SHALL use CSS custom properties for theming
2. WHEN implementing component styles THEN the system SHALL follow the existing CSS organization patterns
3. WHEN replacing styled components THEN the system SHALL maintain the current design system colors, typography, and spacing
4. WHEN creating reusable components THEN the system SHALL support theme variants and customization props
5. IF components need dynamic styling THEN the system SHALL use CSS-in-JS or computed style properties

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all existing functionality remains intact after the migration, so that users experience no disruption in their workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating components THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing props, events, and slots
2. WHEN replacing form components THEN the system SHALL maintain validation, error handling, and data binding
3. WHEN updating navigation components THEN the system SHALL preserve routing and state management
4. WHEN migrating complex components (Monaco Editor, Vue Flow) THEN the system SHALL ensure all integrations continue to work
5. WHEN testing migrated components THEN the system SHALL verify all user interactions and workflows function correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to improve code organization and maintainability, so that the codebase is easier to understand and modify.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring component logic THEN the system SHALL extract reusable composables following VueUse patterns
2. WHEN organizing component files THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing file structure conventions
3. WHEN creating utility functions THEN the system SHALL prefer VueUse composables over custom implementations
4. WHEN implementing shared logic THEN the system SHALL create custom composables that follow VueUse naming conventions
5. WHEN documenting components THEN the system SHALL include JSDoc comments for props, events, and composables

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize bundle size and performance, so that the application loads faster and uses fewer resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN removing PrimeVue THEN the system SHALL eliminate unused dependencies from package.json
2. WHEN implementing custom components THEN the system SHALL use tree-shaking friendly imports
3. WHEN adding VueUse THEN the system SHALL import only the specific composables needed
4. WHEN optimizing components THEN the system SHALL use lazy loading for heavy components
5. WHEN measuring performance THEN the system SHALL verify that bundle size is reduced compared to the PrimeVue implementation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain TypeScript type safety throughout the migration, so that we catch errors at compile time and have better IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating custom components THEN the system SHALL define proper TypeScript interfaces for all props and emits
2. WHEN using VueUse composables THEN the system SHALL leverage their built-in TypeScript definitions
3. WHEN refactoring logic THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve type safety
4. WHEN creating custom composables THEN the system SHALL provide proper return type definitions
5. WHEN integrating with existing code THEN the system SHALL ensure no TypeScript errors are introduced
