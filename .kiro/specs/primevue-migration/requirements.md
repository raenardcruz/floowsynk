# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the existing FloowSynk application from custom UI components to PrimeVue components. The goal is to standardize the UI library, improve consistency, reduce maintenance overhead, and leverage PrimeVue's comprehensive component ecosystem. Where PrimeVue components are too complex for simple use cases, simplified wrapper components will be created to maintain ease of use.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use PrimeVue components throughout the application, so that we have a consistent and well-maintained UI library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all custom UI components SHALL be replaced with PrimeVue equivalents
2. WHEN a PrimeVue component is too complex for simple use cases THEN a simplified wrapper component SHALL be created
3. WHEN migrating components THEN the existing functionality and styling SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN using PrimeVue components THEN they SHALL follow PrimeVue's theming and styling conventions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simplified wrapper components for complex PrimeVue components, so that I can use them easily without dealing with unnecessary complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PrimeVue component has many configuration options THEN a wrapper component SHALL provide sensible defaults
2. WHEN creating wrapper components THEN they SHALL expose only the most commonly used props and events
3. WHEN wrapper components are created THEN they SHALL maintain the same API as the original custom components where possible
4. WHEN wrapper components are used THEN they SHALL still allow access to advanced PrimeVue features when needed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to be systematic and organized, so that the codebase remains maintainable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating components THEN they SHALL be organized in a logical directory structure
2. WHEN replacing components THEN all imports and references SHALL be updated accordingly
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN no unused custom components SHALL remain in the codebase
4. WHEN new components are created THEN they SHALL follow the established naming conventions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain its current functionality and appearance, so that the migration is transparent to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are migrated THEN the visual appearance SHALL remain consistent with the current design
2. WHEN user interactions occur THEN they SHALL work exactly as before the migration
3. WHEN forms are submitted THEN validation and data handling SHALL function identically
4. WHEN responsive behavior is tested THEN it SHALL work across all supported screen sizes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript support for all PrimeVue components, so that I have type safety and good developer experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using PrimeVue components THEN they SHALL have proper TypeScript definitions
2. WHEN creating wrapper components THEN they SHALL export proper TypeScript interfaces
3. WHEN component props are used THEN they SHALL be type-checked at compile time
4. WHEN events are handled THEN they SHALL have proper type definitions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain the existing component architecture patterns, so that the codebase structure remains familiar and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating components THEN the existing file structure patterns SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN components have hooks, styles, and types files THEN these SHALL be maintained or consolidated appropriately
3. WHEN components are exported THEN they SHALL maintain the same export patterns
4. WHEN component documentation exists THEN it SHALL be updated to reflect PrimeVue usage
